            <img class="pet" src="images/jingle.jpg" alt="Picture of Jingle" width="300">


            <p>Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His
                paws are
                white and they look like mittens.
                Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get
                injured.
                Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes
                crazy
                and meows to go out.</p>

            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside;
                a bee
                stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for
                four
                days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>

            <img class="pet" src="images/bacon.jpeg" width="300" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <img class="pet" src="images/Finn_Halloween.jpg" width="300" alt="3.	Finn wears a bat costume for halloween ">

            <p>Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I’m just gonna go with grey.
                He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as well be a
                dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can only describe him as goofy and chaotic. </p>
            <p>Finn’s biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not it’s because his vet is an MSU alum, but he
                doesn’t like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office because
                he’ll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years. </p>

            <p>Sofie is very old, she joined our family when I was still in a car seat. Sofie loves the weekends because
                she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on the trail, where

                likes going out on walks anytime of the day except when it is thunder storming, he will be running
                around the house trying to find a place to hide.</p>
            <p>After every walk, Oreo will always get the zoomies, or he will want to play fetch. He has a set schedule
                everyday where he likes to eat early morning around 9am and at night at 7pm. Oreo is a very high

            <p>Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat
                anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a
                loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is
                atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
            </p>
            <p>Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon
                by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they
                reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes
                painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look
                pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health. </p>

            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like
                a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own
                name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</p>
